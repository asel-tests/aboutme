# Hi!  
Welcome to my page.  

I'm **Mohamad Ali Jarkas**, a guy.  

This is where you can learn about my previous, current, and future projects and interests.

---

## AI / ML
- Researched different architectures for LLM classification tasks with **lmsys**.  
- Suggested a new **parallel BERT architecture** to increase the context window and allow more input tokens.

---

## Signal Processing
- Designed an **AWGN codebase in C++** to simulate different coding and decoding techniques, including polar codes.  
  - Supports multithreading.  
  - Uses CMake.

## Internships & Work

### Arkalumen
- Designed and implemented a **Windows app** in C# and .NET for CCT interpolation using cubic spline interpolation.  
  - Implemented OS concepts such as mutexes.  
- Designed and implemented a **USB Type-C PD compliant PCB** to allow programming and debugging of a microcontroller through one port.  
  - Switched between DEBUG mode (ICSP pins connected to USB) and regular USB 2.0 operation.  
- Debugged LED controller PCBs and firmware.  
- Developed **ESP32 firmware** in C for:
  - BLE communication.  
  - PWM signal generation to drive LED strips.  
  - ADC current sensing for feedback loops.  
- Conducted experiments measuring:
  - Thermal efficiency of controllers.  
  - Effect of heat on capacitance degradation in ceramic capacitors (<1206 footprint).  
- Represented Arkalumen in communications with international partner companies.  
- Hid a colleague’s desktop so well they couldn’t find it for a whole day after they stole my car keys.

### Cisco Systems
- First actual **software development internship**.  
- Learned OS concepts, Linux signaling libraries, synchronous and asynchronous callback functions.  
- Developed a **feature for Cisco IOS-XE**:
  - Overhauled a critical real-time operation.  
  - Trimmed the existing codebase and increased speed significantly.  
  - Migrated reliance from custom libraries to native Linux libraries.  
  - Set the basis for future work.  
- Technologies used: **C, Bash, Python**.

### Rianta Solutions (before acquisition by Marvell)
- Learned about the **business side of engineering**: acquisitions and transition periods.  
- Technical work:  
  - Used **SystemVerilog** and **UVM library** to create a testbench with constrained-random stimulus.  
  - Applied **functional coverage**.  
  - Integrated, debugged, and simulated an **Ethernet IP RTL wrapper**.  
- Biggest takeaway: learned **Vim**, now use **Neovim** daily.  

---

### MATE ROV (Kelpie team)
- Founding member, later **Electrical Team Lead**.  
- Designed the original **power distribution system** for the ROV.  
- Wrote and implemented a **PMBus library (I²C)** to communicate with a DC step-down converter.  
- Learned the importance of **good documentation** for production-ready products.  

---

### University of Ottawa Research
- Debugged **ESP32 controllers** using BLE and LoRa for communication.  
- Learned to fly drones, designed experiments, created professional figures.  
- Co-published first research paper.  
- Conducted a **literature and commercial review** of haptic jackets.  
- Designed and implemented a **haptic jacket prototype**:  
  - Created proposal, soldered PWM motors.  
  - Used an **NVIDIA Jetson** for control.  
  - Co-authored a second publication (pending).
